#
# The maildist (Mail Distribution) file is used by the loginfo script
# and serves two purposes:
#
#  - specifiying the recipients of commit messages.
#  - specifiying the file to save commit messages to.
#
# The format is:
#
#  <module[/dir...]|ALL|DEFAULT><white space><distribution list>
#
#  The distribution list is a comma or white space separated list of
#  file names and/or email addresses.
#
# A matching repository is a module[/dir...] in the first column that
# matches the repository or is a parent of the repository.
#
# For a matching repository, the commit message is sent to each email
# address in the distribution list and for each file name in the 
# distribution list, the commit message it appended to the file
# %CVSROOT%\CVSROOT\commitlogs\<file name>.
#
# If no matching repository is found, the distribution list specified
# by DEFAULT in the first column is used.
#
# In addition, any distribution list specified by ALL in the first
# column is also used.
#
# Using the example below:
#
#  If the repository is module then commit messages are sent to
#  module@ping.at, dir@ping.at, and all@ping.at as well as appended
#  to the files ...\commitlogs\module, ...\commitlogs\dir, and
#  ...\commitlogs\all.
#
#  If the repository is module/dir then commit messages are sent to
#  dir@ping.at and all@ping.at as well as appended to the files
#  ...\commitlogs\dir and ...\commitlogs\all.
#
#  If the repository is module/test then commit messages are sent to
#  all@ping.at and default@ping.at as well as appended to the files
#  ...\commitlogs\all and ...\commitlogs\default.
#
#module			module, module@ping.at
#module/dir		dir, dir@ping.at
#ALL			all, all@ping.at
#DEFAULT		default, default@ping.at
