#
# The avail file determines whether you may commit files.  It contains
# lines read from top to bottom, keeping track of a single "bit".  The
# "bit" defaults to "on".  It can be turned "off" by "unavail" lines and
# "on" by "avail" lines.  ==> Last one counts.
#
# Any line not beginning with "avail" or "unavail" is ignored.
#
# Lines beginning with "avail" or "unavail" are assumed to be '|'-
# separated triples: (All spaces and tabs are ignored in a line.)
#
#   {avail.*,unavail.*} [| user,user,... [| repos,repos,...]]
#
#    1. String starting with "avail" or "unavail".
#    2. Optional, comma-separated list of usernames.
#    3. Optional, comma-separated list of repository pathnames.
#   These are pathnames relative to %CVSROOT%.  They can be directories
#   or filenames.  A directory name allows access to all files and
#   directories below it.
#
# Example:  (Text from the ';;' rightward may not appear in the file.)
#
#   unavail                 ;; Make whole repository unavailable.
#   avail|ahuber            ;; Except for user "ahuber".
#   avail|fred, john|bin/ls ;; Except when "fred" or "john" commit to
#                           ;; the module whose repository is "bin/ls"
#
#unavail
#avail|ahuber
